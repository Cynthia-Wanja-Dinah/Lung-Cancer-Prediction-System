🎓 Capstone Project — ENGAGE Training Program in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence
By: Cynthia Wanja, Mary Njuguna, Precious Wafula

🧠 Project Overview
Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers globally due to its late-stage diagnosis. Traditional methods such as imaging and biopsies often detect the disease when it is already advanced, limiting treatment options and reducing survival rates.

Our project proposes a machine learning-based solution to enable early detection and intervention using patient data—especially in resource-constrained public health settings.


🩺 Problem Statement
Despite being preventable and treatable when detected early, lung cancer is often diagnosed too late, particularly in low-resource areas. This delay leads to:

Increased treatment costs

Reduced survival rates

Strain on public health systems

💡 Our Solution
We developed a Logistic Regression-based prediction model that uses key health features to assess a patient’s risk of lung cancer. The goal is to:

Identify high-risk individuals early

Support public health screening

Reduce diagnostic costs

🎯 Project Objectives
✅ Build a predictive model for early lung cancer detection

✅ Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve

✅ Apply model insights to guide public health decisions

✅ Empower clinicians and stakeholders through accessible, interpretable tools

🗂️ Dataset
Source: Kaggle

Content: Patient records with features such as:

Gender

Age

Smoking history

Anxiety

Yellow fingers

Chronic diseases

And more

These features were chosen based on their clinical relevance to lung cancer risk.

🧪 Methodology
Logistic Regression for binary classification (cancer/no cancer)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in risk factors

Model evaluation using:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy Score

Precision, Recall

ROC-AUC Curve

💻 User Interface (Future Scope)
The team envisions a user-friendly web interface for:

Uploading patient data

Visualizing predictions

Integrating with hospital systems

Educating users on lung cancer risk factors

🧬 Public Health Contribution
Promotes early screening and diagnosis

Reduces financial and emotional burden on patients

Empowers data-driven decisions in healthcare

Contributes to preventive care strategies

🚀 Future Work
Extend the model to support multiclass classification (e.g., cancer stages)

Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

Integrate other ML models like Random Forest or XGBoost

Collaborate with healthcare institutions for real-world testing
